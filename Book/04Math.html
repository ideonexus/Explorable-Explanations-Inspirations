    <h1>Explorable Explanation Inspirations</h1>





    <h2>Mathematics</h2>



    <h3>Elementary</h3>

    <p>As with the <em>Abcedarian</em> section of the <em>Literacy</em> section, these are appliations <em>targeted</em> to elementary school level students with which they may plan, not applications they can build. But, these are applications a Middle or High school student could build fairly easily.</p>

    <p>Also as with the <em>Abcedarian</em> literacy apps, Montessori toys are a deep well of ideas from which to pull inspiration for applications. ... Montessori Hundred Board ... Montessori Counting Beads... <b>Cardinality Visualizer</b> ... Gives them a little bonus of putting a square around groups of wingdings that are squared numbers.</p>

    <p>While my visualizer is nice for helping very young students associate quantities the numbers representing them, it could be exposing children to so much more. There's a book my children love, <em>Counting With Monsters</em>, which pairs up every prime number with a picture of a monster. Every non-prime number is paired up with a picture of its prime-factor number-monsters merged into one another. I would love to see a developer craft an algorithm to create <em>patterns</em> with each number, even if it's just groups of prime-factors, like three groups of threes for nine or five fives for 25. There could even be <em>n</em>-sided shapes in which to group each prime less than <b>X</b>, like a triangle for three, pentagon for five, and a heptagon for seven.</p>

    <p><b>Prime Factor Tree</b> ... While there is an element of exploration in generating trees for various numbers, we can make this application even more immersive by having the student enter factors and "grow" the tree with each new factor entered.</p>

    <p>I love how factor trees bring out and highlight the <em>beauty</em> of mathematics. We can find so much wonder in mathematical ideas. A great example of this is a <b>Number Mandela Generator</b> ... </p>



    <p><b>Exponents</b> Fable of the chessboard: a loop to demonstrate exponents. If you google "html5 chessboard," you'll find lots of easy (if a little tedious) chessboard designs to incorporate into your app. </p>

    <p><b>Interesting Number Tester</b> Sheldon, the uber-nerd from the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> sitcom, in one episode extols the virtues of his favorite number, The best number is 73. Why? 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying 7 and 3... and in binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001."

    <h3>Calculus</h3>

    <p>Being mathed-out in high school, I skipped calculus, but always regretted doing so. Years later when I picked up a calculus textbook, I was pleasantly surprised to find I had spent the last decade of my programming career applying calculus in my daily life....</p>
